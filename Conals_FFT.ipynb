    "\n",
    "About 2 years ago, I listened to Conal Elliott give a talk at the *Haskell Hackers at the Hacker Dojo* meetup on having achieved new levels of efficiency of implementation of the *parallel scan* algorithm. I got very excited about this, because parallel scan is one of these algorithms, which greatly benefits from a logarithmic \"divide and conquer\" breakdown in which the problem of calculating scan of some data structure is broken down into finding the scan of a number of subsets of the original data set, recombining these sub-results to form the final answer. By doing so, some redundancy in the more straightforward approach is removed, and the total work required to complete the calculation reduced from, typically, $O(N^2)$ to $O(Nlog_2N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "I use another member of this class of algorithm in my daily work: the *Fast Fourier Transform* (FFT). I, like most, had always assumed that $O(N log_2 N)$ was the best we could do in calculating the FFT of a data set. After hearing Conal's talk, I wondered if this was really true. I began a Haskell project to start investigating this: [TreeViz](https://wiki.haskell.org/Treeviz). When I showed TreeViz to Conal, he was intrigued, but noted that I'd made an unfortunate choice: I'd \"hard-wired\" my implementation to be dependent upon the *List* functor as the enclosing data container. (At that time, I hadn't made it very far past List, with regard to my Haskelling.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Conal suggested that we search for a more generic mode of expressing the FFT computation. This [IHaskell](https://github.com/gibiansky/ihaskell) notebook attempts to capture the historical record of our journey from the List-centric implementation in TreeViz to a very recent breakthrough of Conal's, which has enabled a completely generic expression of the FFT, valid for a much broader class of functors.\n",

    "\n",
    "- TypeCompose\n",
    "- treeviz\n",

Note, furthermore, that each new functor for which we'd like to define an FFT instance will need its own unique definition of this function. If we did an instance for _LTree_, we'd need to find its alternatives to toB and bottomSplit, as those functions don't exist for LTree. Even more insidiously, if more subtly, note that our FFT instance for Pair presumes that we're using _decimation in time_ (DIT) to perform the logarithmic breakdown.

    "#### FFT Class Definition <a name=\"fft_class_definition\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing that stands out in Conal's new code is the type signature of both the _FFT_ class definition, as well as its sole member function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "type DFTTy f f' = forall a. RealFloat a => f (Complex a) -> f' (Complex a)\n",
    "\n",
    "class FFT' f f' | f -> f' where\n",
    "  fft' :: DFTTy f f'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, despite the slight change of syntax (i.e. - \"fft\" => \"fft'\" & \"FFT\" => \"FFT'\"), here, which was made only to avoid conflict with the previous definition of the FFT class in this notebook, Conal's actual code continues to use \"fft\" and \"FFT\". So, I will also use those labels, here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas, previously, we'd assumed that the _fft_ function should map from a functor to the same functor, here we are allowing the enclosing functor to change. (It was, in fact, this insight, which broke the log jam referred to, above, wherein we were led to believe that we needed two different type signatures for the fft function.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functor Composition Instance <a name=\"functor_composition_instance\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, consider the FFT instance definition for a general composition of functors:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "instance ( Applicative f , Traversable f , Traversable g\n",
    "         , Applicative f', Applicative g', Traversable g'\n",
    "         , FFT' f f', FFT' g g', LScan f, LScan g', Sized f, Sized g' ) =>\n",
    "  FFT' (g :. f) (f' :. g') where\n",
    "    fft' = inO (transpose . fmap fft' . transpose . twiddle . fmap fft' . transpose)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the transposition of functors in the instance head (i.e. - from _(g :. f)_ to _(f' :. g')_). Furthermore, note the odd number of calls to the _transpose_ function, in the definition of fft. Finally, recall that the first step in breaking down the DFT computation is a \"de-interleaving\" process, whereby we separate the even and odd members of the original data set. Note that in completing the DFT => FFT conversion we **never undo this de-interleaving**. The transpose function, above, provides this de-interleaving (at least, for the DIT case) in a generic way, assuming very little about the nature of the enclosing functor. (It must just be a _Traversable_.) The fact that we don't want to undo this de-interleaving is consistent with an odd number of calls to transpose, in the definition of fft. However, such an application of an odd number of calls to the transpose function necessarily leaves a functor composition in an \"inverted\" state, where the outer functor has become the inner and vice versa. And, so, we see that Conal's insight, above (i.e. - giving both the class and its sole member function the freedom to transform the enclosing functor), was absolutely necessary, in order to express the FFT of a functor composition in its most natural and elegant form.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pair Instance <a name=\"pair_instance\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, consider Conal's _FFT_ instance for _Pair_:\n",
    "\n",

    "instance FFT' Pair Pair where\n",
    "  fft' (a :# b) = (a + b) :# (a - b)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that he has chosen to express the degenerate form, which completely eliminates any distinction between DIT and DIF decomposition (as well as DFT vs. FFT, for that matter). (Recall our brief aside, above, on Fourier transforming pairs.) In this way, he has given us a completely general purpose building block for constructing the FFT instances for more complicated structures. However, at first glance, he also appears to have ducked the responsibility for properly applying the \"phase twiddles\" to the second member of the incoming pair, in the case when the pair contains stuctures, as opposed to scalar values. Or, has he...\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tree of Pairs <a name=\"tree_of_pairs\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider one of Conal's implementations of the _FFT_ instance for trees, which makes use of his functor composition instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "instance IsNat n => FFT' (LTree n) (RTree n) where\n",

    "     fft'' (Succ _) = RB . unO . fft' . O . l_unB\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note first that, unlike all previous tree instances in this notebook, this instance morphs a _LTree_ into a _RTree_. We'll see why this is a very natural thing to do, shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "(In the discussion, below, I abandon the previous convention of referring to *fft'* in actual code snippets as *fft* in the accompanying exlanatory verbiage, and use the actual names of functions as they appear in the code, as an aid to the reader trying to precisely correlate my verbal explanation with those code snippets.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, note the indirection provided by _fft''_. This is just a syntactical convenience, which obviates the need for the user of our library to take care of passing in the correct tree size. Instead, we use the underlying Haskell dictionary mechanism to infer the proper size automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The leaf case (i.e. - _fft'' Zero_) isn't very interesting. It's essentially just _id_ with the proper functor unwrapping/re-wrapping machinery needed, in order to statisfy the type signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The branch case (i.e. - *fft'' (Succ _)*) is the truly interesting one, and is where Conal's magic is really being performed. Let's take it a step at a time, keeping in mind our goal of finding the, apparently, missing phase twiddles. We'll do this, by constructing a LTree value, carefully sculpted to make tracking the data flow through the computation particularly easy, and applying the fft'' function to it, one step at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll expand the definition of *fft''*, above, using the appropriate definition of *fft'*, namely that taken from the functor composition instance (because, that's what *O* produces). In performing this expansion, I have omitted the triple: *inO* / *O* / *unO*, since their only real function is to force the selection of the proper fft' overload in the code, immediately above:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "fft'' (Succ _) = RB . transpose . fmap fft' . transpose . twiddle . (fmap fft') . transpose . l_unB\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I define a *LTree* in which the values are equal to the position indices of an equivalent list/vector, because it makes tracking the data flow through the computation easier:  \n",

Now, you've seen the details of this funny problem, in all their gory detail.\n",

Let's investigate that a bit further and see where it leads. We'll start by following Conal's lead and using the degenerate case for the Pair instance, so as not to force a DIT implementation, and see if we can make that work."

In fact, there's a more insidious problem lying in wait: if we ask for the FFT of a *Pair* of anything other than scalars, we're going to get the wrong answer, because the *FFT* instance defined for *Pair*, above, is only going to do the summing and differencing.

And, it is precisely the mechanics of functor composition, which allows us this freedom and convenience."
